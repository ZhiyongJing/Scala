Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.
In simple words AWS allows you to do the following things-
Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.
Securely store all your files on the cloud so you can access them from anywhere.
Using managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server to store information.
Deliver static and dynamic files quickly around the world using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Send bulk email to your customers.
Now that you know what you can do with AWS, lets have an overview of various AWS services.
